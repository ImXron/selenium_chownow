# Selenium ChowNow:

Having some fun with Selenium and ChowNow's website!

I'll be using the Page Object Model for this mini (or micro...) framework.

Let's do this!
___

### Setup:
In order to run these tests, you will need to install some dependencies (will dockerize this). I'm assuming you have 
python3 and pip3 already installed.

1. $ pip3 install selenium, pytest
2. Add the directory of this repo to your PYTHONPATH, as this is not a module you can install. You can also run in from Pycharm (faster/easier)
3. Download the official chrome driver and place it in your PATH (root python install directory works too).
3. $ pytest /path/to/selenium_chownow/src/tests
4. ???
5. Profit.
